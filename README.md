## Description
Chronorun is a platform game in a cyberpunk universe. In this game, you'll have the opportunity to play as 3 characters : Cyburger, Lewis and Riley.
The goal of this game is to get as far as possible within the given time.
But there is more, during the game, you'll have different platforms spawning, some of them with effects (speed ans slow).
Bombs that make you lose time and stopwatches that make you win time will also be spawning during your run.
As you have probably noticed already, the game stops when you don't have any time left.
